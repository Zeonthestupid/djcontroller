## CDJ's are so expensive
I feel like we can do better.
I recently got into DJing and though 90% of things can be done with a budget controller such as the FLX-4, some cool stuff is locked behind $3000+ paywalls :(

Especially:
- High precision jogwheels
- Motorized Jogwheels
- CUSTOMIZABLE LAYOUT (HAVEN'T SEEN MUCH)
