## 10/3/2025 - Figuring out how to interface w/ rekordbox  

Writing this because I theorized this project a few days ago (and printed one thing for it), but it's still pretty early.

I planned to build a simple MIDI controller for this that uses a Wii Nunchuk so I can scratch with a joystick! However, Rekordbox (the dj software) blocks MIDI functionality behind a paywall :(

^^ They're so mean for this

I decided I would (instead of doing a MIDI controller) emulate a keyboard instead, since free Rekordbox allows you to DJ with your keyboard. For scratching, I'll just register how fast the rotation is and then keypress that many times. It's limited to how fast I can send keyboard inputs tho.

I hope this isn't the final solution, because I may _eventually_ get Rekordbox, but for now this will have to do
