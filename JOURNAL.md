## 10/3/2025 - Figuring out how to interface w/ rekordbox  

Writing this because I theorized this project a few days ago (and printed one thing for it), but it's still pretty early.

I planned to build a simple MIDI controller for this that uses a Wii Nunchuk so I can scratch with a joystick! However, Rekordbox (the dj software) blocks MIDI functionality behind a paywall :(

^^ They're so mean for this

I decided I would (instead of doing a MIDI controller) emulate a keyboard instead, since free Rekordbox allows you to DJ with your keyboard. For scratching, I'll just register how fast the rotation is and then keypress that many times. It's limited to how fast I can send keyboard inputs tho.

I hope this isn't the final solution, because I may _eventually_ get Rekordbox, but for now this will have to do


  

## 10/4/2025 - Nunchuk input detection  

I figured out somewhat how to get gestures detected. In the code I have it where if the velocity of certain things crosses a threshold, it will activate a gesture, followed by a debounce time.

What this will allow me to do is switch decks without allocating a while key to it! With a very quick flick, I can move from deck to deck (however, it doesn't actually interface with rekordbox yet).

Yay, okay, idk if videos work here but this is it working!

## 10/5/2025 - Working nunchuk control  

I finished the nunchuk interfacing, which ended up being super cool! However, this is only step 1 of the project, because I know I can make it much much cooler!

As of now, with the nunchuk you can press the Z key (bottom back button) and move the joystick to move the selected track forward / backward. I also added in the ability to hotcue by pressing c with the joystick in one of 8 outer positions. You can press c with the joystick in the center to pause the selected deck. 

Deck selection defaults at deck 1 (d0 in the code), but can be changed by shaking the nunchuk.

False shows it's not in deck switch debounce time, the three numbers following are acceleration, then it shows the current deck, and the joystick positions.

I also added in a screen to show which deck is active!

Here's a video of all the features working on conjunction:

As of now you can't change bpm with the controller. This is something I will work on after I pick up some horizontal potentiometers ;)
