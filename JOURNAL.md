## 10/3/2025 - Figuring out how to interface w/ rekordbox  

Writing this because I theorized this project a few days ago (and printed one thing for it), but it's still pretty early.

I planned to build a simple MIDI controller for this that uses a Wii Nunchuk so I can scratch with a joystick! However, Rekordbox (the dj software) blocks MIDI functionality behind a paywall :(

^^ They're so mean for this

I decided I would (instead of doing a MIDI controller) emulate a keyboard instead, since free Rekordbox allows you to DJ with your keyboard. For scratching, I'll just register how fast the rotation is and then keypress that many times. It's limited to how fast I can send keyboard inputs tho.

I hope this isn't the final solution, because I may _eventually_ get Rekordbox, but for now this will have to do


  

## 10/4/2025 - Nunchuk input detection  

I figured out somewhat how to get gestures detected. In the code I have it where if the velocity of certain things crosses a threshold, it will activate a gesture, followed by a debounce time.

What this will allow me to do is switch decks without allocating a while key to it! With a very quick flick, I can move from deck to deck (however, it doesn't actually interface with rekordbox yet).

Yay, okay, idk if videos work here but this is it working!

## 10/5/2025 - Working nunchuk control  

I finished the nunchuk interfacing, which ended up being super cool! However, this is only step 1 of the project, because I know I can make it much much cooler!

As of now, with the nunchuk you can press the Z key (bottom back button) and move the joystick to move the selected track forward / backward. I also added in the ability to hotcue by pressing c with the joystick in one of 8 outer positions. You can press c with the joystick in the center to pause the selected deck. 

Deck selection defaults at deck 1 (d0 in the code), but can be changed by shaking the nunchuk.

False shows it's not in deck switch debounce time, the three numbers following are acceleration, then it shows the current deck, and the joystick positions.

I also added in a screen to show which deck is active!

Here's a video of all the features working on conjunction:

As of now you can't change bpm with the controller. This is something I will work on after I pick up some horizontal potentiometers ;)  

## 10/6/2025 3 PM - handpicked parts  

The nunchuk works, but I can't do much more with it, hence why I am moving to proper parts for the remainder of the project!

I decided to order it in the hope that I can offset some of the costs with the grant, but it's completely fine if that's a small portion (I ordered a lot because of Digikey's bulk pricing).

The biggest purchase risk I'm taking is ordering a $45 encoder for the jogwheel. It's risky because i can't really use it for other projects (or at least I don't need something that precise). I'm getting a 2223-AMT102-D2048-I6000-S-ND, which 2048 pulses per rotation, meaning I get hyper precise movement data.

This is the full cart:

It's crazy how a lot of bits and bobbers is $160 now, but it's actually so chill since this should carry me through the whole project.

It's interesting because I can most likely implement as many features as a CDJ3000 has (minus the screen because I don't want one), but for a tiny fraction of the price!

  

## 10/6/2025 5 PM - Sketching wiring  

This was the sketch of the EQ module, which is going to have 5 rotary pots and 1 horizontal pot

![20251006_113029.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Nzg1LCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--bbb61eb4afebf9d0f2d808a60f06896cad1ccfb0/20251006_113029.jpg)

Then I decided "hold up why don't I make it a little modular so it's easier to move?

so i'm doing it modular now !! (I keep making this more complicated for myself lol)

If I want to make this modular, I'm gonna need quite a few extra features to make it happen. One of them, is to create connection points on every main module, each with some type of index so the control board can figure out what is where.

Then I figured out at least where the connection points will go, and how passthrough wires will work. Passthroughs are going to be hard, but because I'm only making a few modules (2 deck EQ, Browser / fx, Screen (x2), Decks (x2), and the hotcues (and the control board one)) I can just size things so there's only 5 spots for a connection point type, and just make them have diff connectors.

The screens can go anywhere on the top so I just wire passthrough from the control to the tops of decks. The hotcues are on the bottom, but need diff voltages because they will work differently at different spots. 

Those are the complicated ones, the rest are passthrough.

## 10/8/2025 4 PM - First PCB  

So I ordered some parts from digikey! (See: handpicked parts), but I realized I wanted to make some "backpack" type 1-2 layer PCBs so that I wouldn't have to mount it in a wonky way.

The problem with these, is that if I build ones specifically for modules such as the EQ module, I can't add much more onto it!

That being said, I'm pretty clear on what I want the v1 to look like, so I can most likely just print a full eq module out and not have too many failed pieces. Seems like shipping will be an issue, so I'm going to print some single encoder pieces that I can use for either this or a future project.

I finally learnt how to properly use EasyEDA, so I designed a simple piece with it!

It's a very simple 3 encoder design!

I will need to make sure it all works, and will end up exporting so I can check with Onshape (because I know that better than easyeda), however this is a good first step!
  

## 10/8/2025 7 PM - 4 new PCBs  

I started by making my full EQ module

![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTEwMiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--835bf9f858b37265f3da103d560648a4210f1653/image.png)

This was great.. until I looked at the price. Surprisingly it would be better to have each thing individually. 

I also have 100mm pots to worry about (for BPM changing exclusively), so I will be printing extra of those!

![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTEwMywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--fb51ae6e1bbc2ef7dbf430222921047521879521/image.png)
(Those are the 100mm ones!)

Then I spent 1.5 hours trying to manually lay where the holes of a component went, only to realize there was one already on EasyEDAs directory smh...

Anyways these are the other ones:
